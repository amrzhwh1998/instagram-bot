# Instagram Bot README

This is a Python script for an Instagram bot that uses the `tkinter` library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and the `selenium` library for automating actions on the Instagram website. The bot performs various tasks such as following users, unfollowing users, liking posts, sending messages, and commenting on posts.

## Prerequisites

To run the Instagram bot, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3: You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- `tkinter` library: This library is usually included with Python installations.
- `selenium` library: You can install the `selenium` library using the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install selenium
  ```

- `webdriver_manager` library: You can install the `webdriver_manager` library using the following command:

  ```shell
  pip install webdriver_manager
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or save the script to your local machine.

2. Open the script in a Python code editor or IDE.

3. Set up your Instagram account credentials and other configurations in the script:

   - Replace the placeholders `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your Instagram account username and password in the following lines:

     ```python
     user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
     pwd = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
     ```

   - Configure other settings according to your preferences.

4. Save the changes in the script.

5. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

6. The graphical user interface (GUI) window will open.

7. Use the GUI to interact with the Instagram bot and perform tasks such as following users, unfollowing users, liking posts, sending messages, and commenting on posts.

8. Follow the instructions provided in the GUI for each specific task.

9. The script may prompt you to provide inputs such as the number of users to follow, tracking names, comments, etc. Enter the required information in the corresponding text boxes provided in the GUI.

10. The script will automate the desired actions on the Instagram website based on your inputs.

11. You can exit the script by clicking on the "Exit" or "Close" button in the GUI.

**Note:** Make sure to comply with Instagram's terms of service and usage guidelines while using this script. Automating actions on Instagram may violate their policies, and your account could be at risk of being restricted or suspended. Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.

## Limitations
